				<p>The Project Inventory is a database designed to help users 
					identify restoration opportunities and completed projects 
					in Rhode Island watersheds. The projects represent several 
					collaborative efforts to identify restoration activities in 
					the state. The projects are classed as "potential" (unfunded),
					 "ongoing" (funded but not yet completed), or "complete." These
					  efforts include Save The Bay's volunteer salt marsh evaluations, 
					  the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program's Habitat Restoration Charrette 
					  (PDF file), and the efforts of the Coastal Resources 
					  Management Council to identify restoration opportunities 
					  with the Army Corps of Engineers and through the regulatory
					   permit process.</p>

				<p>The majority of the projects in the Project Inventory are salt 
					marsh restoration, eelgrass restoration, or anadromous fish run (
					Alewife or Blueback Herring) restoration projects. The Project 
					Inventory contains information about the restoration site 
					including where the site is located, the organizations 
					involved with the site, the type of impact to the resources
					 and contact information for the project leader. Other types
					  of information the user will see include the following:

				<ul class="other">
					<li class="disc">A photo of the site</li>
					<li class="disc">Target species</li>
					<li class="disc">Historic conditions</li>

				<p>The Project Inventory includes two tools to help identify restoration projects:</p>
				<p>The Project Inventory Search Tool allows users to identify restoration projects 
					based on a particular topic or combination of two topics. For example, a
					 user can search the database for projects of a particular habitat type 
					 (such as coastal wetland), or a user could narrow the search to projects 
					 of a particular habitat type (such as coastal wetland) within a particular 
					 geographic area (such as town or county).
						The Project Inventory Map allows users to directly access information from the 
					database pertaining to specific projects by clicking on mapped project sites.
 					Please be patient while map loads slowly into your browser.</p>

				<p>In addition to the projects accessed through the inventory, interested parties
					 may click here the see a description (pdf document) of the projects 
					 that were funded through the Coastal and Estuarine Habitat Restoration 
					 Program and Trust Fund. This fund was created through 2003 legislation 
					 that amended the 1996 Oil Spill Prevention Administration and Response
					  Act (OSPAR) resulting from the 1996 North Cape Oil Spill.
